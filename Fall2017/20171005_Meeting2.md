## Agenda:
- Installation (Ian):
	- conda 
	    - Can handle non-Python dependencies as well
	    - Package manager of the Anaconda Python distribution
	    - might be able to provide virtual environment
	    - switch between python2 and python3
	    - Useful commands:
	    	- `conda install $package`
          - `conda build $package`	    
	- pip
	    - Python packages only
       - map pip3 to the $Path or conda can install directly to your path
    	- Useful commands:
	        - `pip install $package`
	        - _For linux/mac_ `pip install -U --user $package` #installs it in your $HOME directory (-U is upgrade)
	        - `pip uninstall $package`
	        - `pip install --upgrade $package`
	        - `pip freeze | grep $package`
	        - `pip install MySQL_python==1.2.2`
        
    - Other ways to install things
        - bioconda
	        - handles dependencies of random programs
	    - docker <-- combee or software carpentry might have a workshop on this later
	    - [singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov/) (like docker - developed by LBL)

- IDE (Integrated development environment)
    - Why use an IDE?
        - Syntax completion
        - save objects
        - Linting
	- jupyter_lab (Ian)
	    - https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab
	- pyCharm (Elizabeth) 
	    - dark 
	    - https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
	    - "Community" version is the free version
	- jupyter_notebook (Huan)
		- [For an intro or to set it up] (http://www.datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/setup)
	- spyder (not talked about today because nobody volunteered to talk about it but) [linked here](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/)
	    - If you love Rstudio you might love spyder, from what I understand it is based on the Rstudio setup (I agree)
	- Arguments for one v the other..
	    - [pycharm vs spyder](https://www.marsja.se/pycharm-vs-spyder-comparing-ides/)
- Data structure
	- [list, set, dictionary] (https://github.com/ComBEE-UW-Madison/PythonStudyGroup/blob/master/Fall2017/Practice/Data_structure.ipynb)
 (Huan)
		- tuple: almost the same as a list but it is unmutable
	- arrays and dataframes (Sarah)  
	We didn't get to talk about it but here are some helpful links. 
	    - [Numpy arrays](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.array.html)
	    - [pandas data structures](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html)
	    - [pandas dataframes](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html)
	    - [pandas series](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.html)
	    - [numpy vs pandas performance](http://gouthamanbalaraman.com/blog/numpy-vs-pandas-comparison.html)
- Open discussion (didn't get here either): 
	- syntax (Ed)
	- other than syntax


## Other Resources:

[Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) is a series of Jupyter Notebooks covering IPython, Intro to numpy, data manipuatlion with pandas, visualization with matplotlib, and machine learning. Chapters 2 and 3 cover the arrays/dataframes section that we were going to get to today. I highly recommend this resource, I really like his explanations of numpy specifically and code examples. In the future you also want to make easy but effective plots with matplotlib, the chapter on that is great as well!
